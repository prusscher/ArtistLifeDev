# How to play
After starting the game, you'll be greated with the Main Menu screen. From here you can either start the game or edit the settings of the application by clicking on either of the two onscreen buttons. The settings screen allows you to modify the game's resolution to the available resolutions of your PC, the Volume of the Game, Music, and Sound effects.

The Start Game button takes you to the Main Game screen. The onscreen action button and pause button allow you to play the game or pause the game and modify settings/leave the game. From the action menu you can select Make Art to bring up the Art creation menu. From here you can select the type and subject of art to make. Your select will effect how well people percieve your art as well as how much money you recieve for making it. Back at the action menu, you can select either Nap or Sleep to recoop the energy lost by making art. Be warned that making too much art without resting can result in a loss of stats and more energy.

The items and customization buttons currently do nothing.
